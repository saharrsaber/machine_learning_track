# Machine Learning Scientist in Python Track
Each Jupyter notebook represents a course in [DataCamp Machine Learning in Python Track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python?version=1). It contains the main algorithms that were explained in the course, and how I implement these algorithms to real-world datasets.
